#### SS7 Stack and Security
The Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) is a globally used set of telephony signaling protocols that enable call setup, routing, billing, and information exchange between telephone networks. The SS7 protocol suite is organized into a stack, structured in levels similar to the OSI model:

1. **MTP Level 1 (Physical Layer):** Physical and electrical connection for the network, handling delivery of signaling messages.
2. **MTP Level 2 (Link Layer):** Error checking and message sequence control, ensuring reliable transmission.
3. **MTP Level 3 (Network Layer):** Message routing between exchanges and integrity of signaling message transfer.
4. **SCCP (Signaling Connection Control Part):** Enhanced routing, supporting connection-oriented and connectionless services.
5. **TCAP (Transaction Capabilities Application Part):** Non-circuit-related queries and transactions (e.g., number translation, roaming).
6. **ISUP (ISDN User Part):** Setup and teardown of voice/data calls over PSTN.
7. **MAP (Mobile Application Part):** Mobile network functions such as roaming, location updating, handovers, and SMS delivery.

**Security Relevance:**
- SS7 has several well-documented vulnerabilities, including subscriber information disclosure, network information disclosure, traffic interception, fraud, and denial of service.
- Attackers can exploit SS7 to intercept calls and SMS, track location, and perform fraud.
- Understanding the SS7 stack and its vulnerabilities is crucial for telecom security professionals.
